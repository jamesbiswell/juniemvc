Analyze the attached ERD image. Create detailed instructions for a Java developer to implement the relationships in JPA with Lombok.

----------------------------------------

- Analyze the file `/prompts/create-beer-order/requirements-draft.md` (ignore any files ending with `-guru.md`) and inspect the project.
- Improve and rewrite the draft requirements to a new file called `/prompts/create-beer-order/requirements.md`.

-----------------------------------------

- Analyze the `prompts/create-beer-order/requirements.md` file (ignore any files ending with `-guru.md`) and create a detailed plan, using Markdown headers and subsections, for the improvements of this project.
- Write the plan to `prompts/create-beer-order/plan.md` file.

-----------------------------------------

- Create a detailed enumerated (i.e. with dotted numbers) task list (using Markdown headers and subsections) according to the suggested enhancements plan in`prompts/create-beer-order/plan.md` (ignore any files ending with `-guru.md`).
- Task items should have a placeholder [ ] for marking as done [x] upon task completion.
- Write the task list to `prompts/create-beer-order/tasks.md` file.

-----------------------------------------

- Complete the task list `prompts/create-beer-order/tasks.md`.
- Inspect the `requirements.md` and `plan.md` and task list `task.md` (ignore any files ending with `-guru.md`).
- Implement the tasks in the task list, completing the tasks in the order in which they appear, where possible.
- After each task is completed, it is essential to update the task list and mark the task as completed (i.e.[x]), only when the required code changes have been done (where necessary).
