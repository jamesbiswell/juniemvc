## Task Description
Your task is to add a patch operation to the Spring MVC controller `${controller_name}`.

To complete this task, complete the following steps:
* Create a new Patch Operation DTO using the naming convention <EntityName>PatchDto. 
* The new patch DTO will not have any NotNull or NotBlank Constraints
* Add an update operation to the Mapstruct mapper which ignores null values using
  `@BeanMapping(nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)` on the update method
  of the mapper.
* Create a new service method which will update an existing entity using the values of the Patch DTO.
* Add additional mapper, service and MockMVC tests to test the patch operation.
* Update the OpenAPI documentation for the new operation and DTO.
* Verify all tests are passing.
* Verify the OpenAPI specification is valid.
